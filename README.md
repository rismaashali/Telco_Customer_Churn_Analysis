# Data Preparation
- Code Used:
  - Python Version: 3.7.15
  - Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, and Warnings

# Data Profiling
Data profiling is the process of reviewing source data, understanding structure, content and interrelationships, and identifying potential for data projects.

# Data Cleansing
- Data cleansing is the process of identifying and resolving corrupt, inaccurate, or irrelevant data. 
- Common inaccuracies in data include missing values, misplaced entries, and typographical errors. In some cases, data cleansing requires certain values to be filled in or corrected, while in other instances, the values will need to be removed altogether.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
- How many churn customers and no churn customers?

  ![churn no churn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113869968/200099130-6e88407e-0e3a-4a90-9af0-bfe3fd6c3dbe.jpg)

  No Churn customers there are as much as 73.46%, while churn customers there are as much as 26.54%.

- How many churn customers based on gender?

  ![gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113869968/200099132-34a88388-e541-4858-b52f-4706f669a99d.jpg)

  Most churn customers are female who are 11.44%. Male churn customers are as many as 11.39% and 3.71% are churn customers that their gender is not known. While the  remaining 73.46% are no churn customers.

- How many churn customers based on senior citizen?

  ![senior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113869968/200099136-7e411cc1-e6f0-4ae9-b02b-c1cea244fddf.jpg)

  From churn customers, the majority are not seniors, which is as much as 17%. 5.84% other are senior citizens and 3.71% are churn customers who are unknown. While the remaining 73.45% are no churn customers.

- How many churn customers based on dependents?

  ![dependents](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113869968/200099131-ed954e46-9081-434f-8928-fc152b935e4f.jpg)

  18.83% of customers are churn customers and have no dependents. While 4% of them have dependents and 3.71% are not known. While the remaining 73.47% are no churn customers.

- How many churn customers based on partner?

  ![partner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113869968/200099135-33538da0-a6cb-44b1-b02a-131b98192851.jpg)

  Most churn customers are customers who don't have a partner, that is as much as 14.65% of all numbers customers. 8.18% have a partner and 3.71% are not known. While the remaining 73.46% are no churn customers.

- Is there multicolinierity between variables?

  ![multi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113869968/200099134-be9d98f7-3e9b-4c5a-8134-3816faa3c2f7.jpg)

  There is a multicollinearity between tenure with Total Charges and Monthly Charges with Total Charges. Then it must be removed one of the variables from the three variables above before modeling

# Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used for creating a predictive model using Machine learning or statistical Modelling.

- One-hot Encoding: is a process of converting categorical data variables so they can be provided to machine learning algorithms to improve predictions.
The Python library Pandas provides a function called get_dummies to enable one-hot encoding
- map() function: to convert numerical data variables can use the map() function
- Scaling
  - Feature scaling is about transforming the values of different numerical features to fall within a similar range like each other. The feature scaling is used to prevent the supervised learning models from getting biased toward a specific range of values.
  - StandardScaler is a class from sklearn.preprocessing which is used for standardization.
  - Standardization is used to center the feature columns at mean 0 with a standard deviation of 1 so that the feature columns have the same parameters as a standard normal distribution.
  
# Preprocessing Data 
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.

- Remove TotalCharges Column because its multicolinear column.
- Checking Importance data using Feature Importance.
- Split Train and Test data to 80%(Train) and 20%(Test)

# Modelling : Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that accomplishes binary classification tasks by predicting the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. The model delivers a binary or dichotomous outcome limited to two possible outcomes: yes/no, 0/1, or true/false.

![model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113870167/200106398-f7af4199-9513-4162-bde9-796821079564.png)
<br>
From the confusion matrix above, the accuracy value of the Logistic Regression model is 82%

### AUC-ROC
AUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes.

![auc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113870167/200106526-b2b23b39-2348-4f57-94a7-2c88634d90f2.png)
<br>
From the AUC-ROC GRAPH and confusion matrix evaluation above, we can know that the AUC value is 86% and also the model is good fit.

### Building a Model With Cross Validation
Cross-Validation is a statistical method of evaluating and comparing learning algorithms by dividing data into two segments: one used to learn or train a model and the other used to validate the model.

### Hyperparameter Tuning in Logistic Regression
From the Grid Search, it is found that the best Hyperparameters value for max_iter is 10, n_jobs is None, penalty is 'l2', and solver is 'saga'.

### Oversampling with SMOTE
SMOTE is an oversampling technique where the synthetic samples are generated for the minority class. This algorithm helps to overcome the overfitting problem posed by random oversampling. It focuses on the feature space to generate new instances with the help of interpolation between the positive instances that lie together.

It can be seen that after an evaluation using oversampling with SMOTE, the accuracy value increases, indicating this is good and the model is fit.

Focus on increasing customer purchases, such as create marketing campaigns to upsell those currently subscribed to streaming movies and TV services on our other internet services. 
- Recommendation for “Device Protection" segment:
Improve the Device Protection service in order to prevent a large number of customer churn who use that service.
- Recommendation for “Streaming TV" segment:
Improve the Streaming TV service in order to prevent a large number of customer churn who use that service.
- Recommendation for “Streaming Movies" segment:
Improve the Streaming Movies service in order to prevent a large number of customer churn who use that service.

Maintain service performance with Mailed Check payment method to prevent customers using that payment method from churn and improve service with Electronic Check payment method so that customers who churn do not get more and more
- Recommendation for "Contract" segment:
Reduce the use of month-to-month contracts, because many customers unsubscribe with month-to-month contracts
- Recommendation for "Technical Support" segment:
Have to improve the Technical support service in order to prevent a large number of customer churn who use that service.
- Recommendation for "Partner" segment:
Have to increase the number of partners in the company in order to reduce unsubscribed customers
